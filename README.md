# Project 3 - *TwitterApplication*

**TwitterApplication** is an android app that allows a user to view his Twitter timeline and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public) allowing you to log into your own twitter account, make tweets, and retweet posts. Other features shows images from posts and other user profiles.

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total
